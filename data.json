Once a team solves the questions, the dataset (same dataset for all teams) will be given to  the team. The dataset will be technical in nature (related to ECE department). Using the answer to the questions as clues, each team must do exploratory analysis on  the dataset and come up with useful insights on the data and on how to proceed further.Then the team must implement a model/algorithm to predict the outputs for the given test values and measure the accuracy metrics along with the predictions."
